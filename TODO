Here is a list of so-called todo list for zhcon.
When will these nice features be ready?
This is always a difficult question to answer.
Things get done when I have the time.
Due to the limitation of my free time (that is, time for hacking
freeware). If someone wants to do such a hack, please contact me.

Known bugs:
Current release is stable for everyday work. However
zhcon is not bug free. Here's some minor bug found so far:
* screen get locked when switching VT very fast
* screen may get blank when quiting from VGA16 mode 

Todo (sorted by priority):
* rewrite zhcon using ucs2 as internal encoding
* rewrite zhcon's VT parser using gterm parser, see http://gterm.sf.net
* use FreeType to render TTF font, so we can display fonts in different points
* input interface clean up
* implement a real intelligent pinyin(wubi) input method (in planning)
* restore previous video mode when quit
* complete bsd port
* port to X-Window(yet another CJK term), may work together with gterm project
* port to MS Windows under cygwin
* speed optimize
