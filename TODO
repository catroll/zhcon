Here is a list of so-called todo list for zhcon.
When will these nice features be ready?
This is always a difficult question to answer.
Things get done when I have the time.
Due to the limitation of my free time (that is, time for hacking
freeware). If someone wants to do such a hack, please contact me.

Known bugs:
Current release is stable for everyday work. However
zhcon is not bug free. Here's some minor bug found so far:
* screen get locked when switching VT very fast
* screen may get blank when quiting from VGA16 mode 

Todo (sorted by priority):
high:
* only set LC_CTYPE on start instead of LC_ALL
* input interface clean up
* complete bsd port
* port to X-Window (yet another CJK term), using SDL
low:
* rewrite zhcon using ucs2 as internal encoding (pending)
* use FreeType to render TTF font, so we can display fonts in different points
* restore previous video mode when quit
* speed optimize
