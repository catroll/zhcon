zhcon can use VGA device on intel machines. Framebuffer device is required for
non-intel machines, and usually gives the best performance.

see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt for more detials on using
framebuffer device.

1) $ ./configure
2) $ make
3) make sure you are root now then type
   $ make install
   to install zhcon

You can use ./configure --prefix=/usr to install zhcon into /usr/bin
If you want to debug, use ./configure --enable-debug=yes to turn on debug
info.

after install you can type zhcon to use.

enjoy!

!!!Please note at this point the BSD support is broken!!!

First,  make sure you have installed gmake,  or GNU Make.
The FreeBSD's make/pmake may work,  but I don't promise that.
Then:

1) $ ./configue
2) $ gmake
3) su to root
4) # gmake install

then type zhcon to enjoy :)

NOTICE AGAIN: Use gmake,  not make!!

You can adjust screen resolution and/or color depth(only for FreeBSD).
Read /etc/zhcon.conf for more details.
