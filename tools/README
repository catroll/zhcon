This directory contains some useful tool written to be used in zhcon.

uc2win: convert UCDOS's dict file into windows ime file format
    usage: ./uc2win < wb.dic > wb.txt 

win2mb: convert windows ime file into zhcon's native ime format(*.mb)
    usage: ./win2mb < winpy.txt > winpy.mb

NOTE:   you must convert all the file from dos format to unix format before start conversation:
    tr -d '-r' < wb.dic >wb.dic.new

just so much document so far;)
